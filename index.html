                <h1>Our Mission</h1>
                <p>Here at EcoPulse our mission is to help save our planet by making fully reusable and eco friendly products to help prevent plastic ending up littered across the world <br>
                in places such as parks, oceans, cities and landfills. It has been proven that the climate has been constantly changing throughout history but we are currently experiencing a rate <br>
                of  global warming that has not been seen in the past 10,000 years. Here at EcoPulse, we are trying to do our part in combating this by selling our reusable products at affordable prices.
            </p>
            <p>We believe in a future where every purchase will be fully eco friendly without materials such as plastics and dyes. We also ensure that we are carbon offsetting on every product we ship <br>
            by aiming to plant a tree to make up for any impact caused to the enviornment when shipping our products to you. We are also hoping to expand globally to eliminate the need for shipping products <br>
            across the world and to help create more jobs in a variety of countries.
            </p>

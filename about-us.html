                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>Here at EcoPulse, our mission is simple. We hope to inspire people across the world to keep the environment in mind when making purchases, <br>
                whether that be while online shopping or shopping in person. At EcoPulse, we believe that making small changes in the way we purchase and <br>
                consume items can make a big difference for the future of our planet. We are hoping to start a movement to inspire not only customers but also <br>
                other companies to help create a better future for the next generations of people.
                </p>

                <h2>Our Commitment To Sustainability</h2>
                <p>Sustainability is an essential part of our business, as our goal is to deliver eco friendly products and to ultimately help the planet. <br>
                Carbon offsetting is something we aim to do at EcoPulse, to minimize any impact on the planet when transporting our products across the <br>
                world. We are hoping to expand our warehouses globally to help prevent the need for transporting goods through the air and to help create <br>
                more jobs across the world. At EcoPulse, while we mainly use renewable energy sources, when that is not possible we do our best to keep <br>
                track of our energy and fuel consumption to offset it through reforestation.

                <h2>Our Vision</h2>
                <p>At EcoPulse, our visison for the future is for single use plastic items such as plastic bottles, cups, straws and more will be eliminated <br>
                by 2030. We are hoping to see a world without litter scattered everywhere you look, and by selling a variety of reusable, biodegradable and <br>
                eco friendly products we hope to make a difference and start a movement. Our vision is big and we are aware that this is not something we can <br>
                do alone, hence why we are hoping that customers join us in this movement by trying their best to shop for eco friendly products such as the <br>
                ones we sell to try make a better tomorrow for future generations.
